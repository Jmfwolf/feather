# millionAntHost

## Overview
Hosting on SBCs in a manner that a script (ducky?) can be run during install and setup can be largely automated.

## Technologies
OPENAPI 3.0.0   *Specification*
https://goa.design *Generation & Design*
https://gohugo.io *Static Site generation*
https://bulma.io  *CSS*

## Rationale
Go is faster than Javascript and requires fewer resources than other scripting languages.
CSS is faster, lighter, and more suitable for mobile devices
Hugo let's us leverage CSS without significantly impairing user experience
Bulma is a CSS library that was made with mobile devices in mind.

### Ideas
---
Create an API for an example to practice. (Perhaps the site Mya wants to make for Aspis to review places, products, and share ideas.
Goa should help leverage the standardization to reduce the real work
Hugo is like Mustache but WAY better
I was thinking of integrating Bulma CSS into static site generation templates.
